## Used Public Suffix Lists

Here, all the public suffix list files are downloaded from the official 
PSL GitHub repository. 
Each file represents a PSL revision probably used by HTTP Archive for a specific month (see the name of the files).
Each revision therefore represents the **_last_** PSL available **_before_** that specific month.
