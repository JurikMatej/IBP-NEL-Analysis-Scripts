# Tranco Lists for NEL Analysis

There is a date, before which the default TRANCO list did not exist.
This means, that the popular domain list has to be generated by custom means.

#### Current state: 

Custom means - Generating TRANCO from the /configure web page (sources: CrUX, Majestic, Radar, Umbrella - defaults):
- tranco_2018_12.csv 
- tranco_2019_01.csv 
- tranco_2019_02.csv 

Default:
- tranco_2019_03.csv
- tranco_2019_04.csv
- tranco_2019_05.csv
- ...every list with later date

#### Filesize too large

Only a few TRANCO lists are versioned on GitHub. 
The rest was uploaded to another location to be shared with the thesis' supervisor.
